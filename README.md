auto-git for the lazy programmer.
========
This short script written in python. Automates the commonly used series of commands:

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master

Using this script in the directory of the git repository you simply
need to press enter to execute the above commands (with default message set
to "update"). You can also enter the directory of your project, a custom message,
and name your branch.
